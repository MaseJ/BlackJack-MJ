# BlackJack
### By Mason Johnson
This game of Black Jack was created in two days using React.js using react-create-app. The gif
was created using Piskel and then just uploaded it straight through there.
This game of Black Jack is a bit simplier than most is the sense that the Aces are hard coded
as 1. Also, when a card is picked the same exact card can be picked again. The coins used to bet are
also replaced back to the default of 300 on refreshing the page. The page is somewhat responsive but 
for smaller screens it may start to break.

### Future plans with this project  
- Add ability to pick value of ace (1 or 11)
- Remove picked cards from deck
- Make sure page is more responsive for smaller screens
 - Add more gifs (those are fun to make)
 
 Go ahead and try out some [Black Jack](https://masej.github.io/BlackJack-MJ/)
### Enjoy!
